## Overview

The Repair Manual Generator simplifies the creation of automotive repair manuals by using a Google Sheets form for data collection. Raw data is processed and formatted by a JavaScript script, resulting in a professional repair manual available for download as a PDF. Due to corporate secrecy, neither the original database, googlesheet form or resulting manuals could be shared.

- **Data Management:** Efficiently sorts and organizes raw data.
- **Automated Formatting:** Produces a formatted repair manual from the data.
- **PDF Download:** Allows the generated manual to be downloaded as a PDF.

2. **Run the Data Processing Script:**
    - Execute the JavaScript script to process the raw data:
    ```bash
    node process-data.js
    ```

3. **Generate and Download Repair Manual:**
